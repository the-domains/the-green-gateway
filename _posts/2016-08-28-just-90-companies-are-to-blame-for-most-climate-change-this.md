  Last month, geographer Richard Heede received a subpoena from Representative
  Lamar Smith (R-TX), chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on
  Science, Space, and Technology. Smith, a climate change doubter, became
  concerned when the attorneys general of several states launched investigations
  into whether ExxonMobil had committed fraud by sowing doubts about climate
  change even as its own scientists knew it was taking place.
