  More than 150 Australian experts have signed on open letter to the prime
  minister, Malcolm Turnbull, demanding urgent action on climate change that
  matches the dire warnings coming from climate scientists. The letter,
  organised by the Australian National University climatologist Andrew Glikson,
  calls on the federal government to make "meaningful reductions of Australia's
  peak carbon emissions and coal exports, while there is still time".
