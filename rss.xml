            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Energy Storage: Can It Ever Happen?</h1><p>Although a predicted growth in electrical energy storage from US$200-m to US$19-by 2017 helps keep the faith, the industry is still confronted with many challenges. There are those who believe that the industry is coming into its own but we think this hype is premature since much of the potential of energy storage has yet to be fully realized and the market has still not taken off in a meaningful way.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9b47f9008f1426a6178659594a6a14d9816475c7.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Dash for Energy Storage Solutions - Renewables Revisited</h1><p>As intermittent energy from renewable sources becomes a significant portion of the grid, storage becomes paramount. It could literally save the renewables sector from collapse. Experts predict that the storage market connected to the wind power industry alone will be worth US$1.1-bn from now to 2015.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/805abf47fa3fc43038eb3b6a49fc52f56334e490.jpg"></article>]]></description>
