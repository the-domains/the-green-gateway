            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>'Tantalisingly close': is solar thermal energy ready to replace coal-fired power?</h1><p>Companies working on large-scale solar thermal projects in Australia say they are tantalisingly close to achieving the dream of building plants big enough to replace coal-fired energy in Australia. Experts speaking at the Australian Solar Energy Exhibition and Conference in Melbourne last week said the technology had been proven in other countries, and projects in Australia were viable, but the challenge was getting major investors to gamble on something new.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/15ebb44485fe0f7877618c671be4208abea8bfc8.jpg"></article>]]></description>
