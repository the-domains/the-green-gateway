            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Energy Storage: Can It Ever Happen?</h1><p>Although a predicted growth in electrical energy storage from US$200-m to US$19-by 2017 helps keep the faith, the industry is still confronted with many challenges. There are those who believe that the industry is coming into its own but we think this hype is premature since much of the potential of energy storage has yet to be fully realized and the market has still not taken off in a meaningful way.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9b47f9008f1426a6178659594a6a14d9816475c7.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Dash for Energy Storage Solutions - Renewables Revisited</h1><p>As intermittent energy from renewable sources becomes a significant portion of the grid, storage becomes paramount. It could literally save the renewables sector from collapse. Experts predict that the storage market connected to the wind power industry alone will be worth US$1.1-bn from now to 2015.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/805abf47fa3fc43038eb3b6a49fc52f56334e490.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Temporary power supporting renewables growth</h1><p>The development of renewable energy has seen major growth due to the need for a more diversified global energy mix and long-term energy security. The EU has experienced a major shift in the last decade away from fossil fuels. According to the European Commission's Renewable energy progress report [2015], 26% of the EU's power is generated from renewables today.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/cfcd3cda570360c7229958910417dda5f1d6098f.jpg"></article>]]></description>
