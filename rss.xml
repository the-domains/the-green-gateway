            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Dash for Energy Storage Solutions - Renewables Revisited</h1><p>As intermittent energy from renewable sources becomes a significant portion of the grid, storage becomes paramount. It could literally save the renewables sector from collapse. Experts predict that the storage market connected to the wind power industry alone will be worth US$1.1-bn from now to 2015.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/805abf47fa3fc43038eb3b6a49fc52f56334e490.jpg"></article>]]></description>
